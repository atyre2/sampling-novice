## Glossary

Accuracy
:	refers to the variance of the estimate of a parameter; how much does the estimated values scatter around the true value.
Bias
:   Bias is the difference between the true value of a parameter and the expected value of an estimate of that parameter.
Random Variable
:	Fundamental building block in statistics. Refers to a measured or estimated quantity that cannot be known exactly, but has some level of stochastic variation
Stochastic
:	from the greek *stokhos*, to aim. Refers to unpredictable variation. 
Validation
:	ensuring that values entered conform to a specific format or list of values, at the moment the value is entered.
Verification
:	ensuring that two different versions of the data match. E.g. values in the database match the datasheet.
