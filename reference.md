## Glossary

Accuracy
:    refers to the variance of the estimate of a parameter; how much does the estimated values scatter around the true value.

Bias
:    Bias is the difference between the true value of a parameter and the expected value of an estimate of that parameter.

Random Variable
:	   Fundamental building block in statistics. Refers to a measured or estimated quantity that cannot be known exactly, but has some level of stochastic variation

Stochastic
:	   from the greek *stokhos*, to aim. Refers to unpredictable variation. 

Validation
:	   ensuring that values entered conform to a specific format or list of values, at the moment the value is entered.

Verification
:	   ensuring that two different versions of the data match. E.g. values in the database match the datasheet.
